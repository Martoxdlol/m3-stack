# M3-Stack

## Message for a Human

I started this project recently, but in the process I've learnt a lot (more than what already knew) about build tools, cjs, esm,
frameworks and more.

It is not my first time trying to build a stack, a useful library or a framework. It won't be the last.

## Docs

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Simple SPA stack for building a web app with react.

Will include:

- React
- TailwindCSS
- BetterAuth
- Hono
- tRPC
- Drizzle ORM

# `better-auth` Setup

1. Run:

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli generate
```

2. Copy output schema to the `src/db/schema/auth.ts` file. You can add things or change things. Be careful to not break important things.
